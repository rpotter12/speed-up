# speed-up
A python game to check your typing speed. This game uses [unicurses library](https://pypi.org/project/UniCurses/). UniCurses is a wrapper for Python 2.x/3.x that provides a unified set of Curses functions on all platforms (MS Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X) with syntax close to that of the original NCurses. To provide the Curses functionality on Microsoft Windows systems it wraps PDCurses. 

## Game Description
- every second new words will flow from left side of your screen to right side of your screen.
- every word will stay on screen for 20 seconds.
- the word will disappear after you have written it.
- this game will tell you the total time taken, words per minute.
- if the word flows from left to right completely and you have not written that word then miss will increase with +1. 

## Rules
- you have to type the words which are on the screen before it gets disappear
- after 10 miss your game will be over
